DevNet project, topic: Configure Access Control List(ACL) on Cisco ASA Firewall

Hello, this is the ✨Bratz✨ team!
Our team consists of Makusutova Dilnaz and Bokey Aliya from group ISNS-1903

On the basis of our topic, we want to say a few words about the technologies that we aim to perform. An ACL is a list of rules with permit or deny statements. Basically an Access Control List enforces the security policy on the network. The Cisco ASA 5500 is the successor Cisco firewall model series which followed the successful Cisco PIX firewall appliance. Without any access-lists, the ASA will allow traffic from a higher security level to a lower security level. All other traffic is dropped. In our project, we will try to implement ACL automation in ACA firewalls using the Python programming language. For the demonstration, we have chosen the following 3 scenarios that we will implement:
- Scenario 1. Configure an Ace to Allow Access to a Web Server Located behind the DMZ
- Scenario 2. Configure an Ace to Allow Access to a Website Only for a Specific Time Duration in a Day
- Scenario 3. Allow Traffic to Pass between Interfaces with the Same Security Level

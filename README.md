## Topic: _Configure Access Control List(ACL) on Cisco ASA Firewall_

Hello, it me Aliya Bokey from group ISNS-1903!

Most of our project will be done together because we need to learn and work through the skills and our knowledge in practice. The only difference is that we have separated scenarios 1 and 2. I will work with Scenario 1. The third scenario we will do together.  Based on the description, my plan is: 
- Studying ACA firewall technology 
- Studying the use of python to configure Cisco devices
- Building a Network for Scenario 1 example
- Building the Network for Scenario 3
- Implementation of Scenario 1 
- Implementation of Scenario 3
- Results
